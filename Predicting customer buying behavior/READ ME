# Predictive Modeling: Customer Booking Prediction

## Project Description

This project involves building a predictive model to identify the likelihood of a customer making a booking. The task includes dataset exploration, feature engineering, machine learning model training, evaluation, and the presentation of insights. The project is designed to enable the team to understand customer behavior and improve booking rates.

## Steps Undertaken

### 1. **Explore and Prepare the Dataset**
- **Objective**: Understand the dataset's structure and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to derive insights.
- **Actions**:
  - Explored data columns and computed basic statistics.
  - Handled missing or inconsistent values.
  - Created new features to enhance model accuracy (e.g., derived attributes based on existing data).
- **Tools Used**: Jupyter Notebook, Python (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).

### 2. **Train a Machine Learning Model**
- **Objective**: Train a model to predict whether a customer makes a booking.
- **Approach**:
  - Chose RandomForest as the primary algorithm for its interpretability and accuracy.
  - Split data into training and testing sets.
- **Tools Used**: Python (`sklearn`).

### 3. **Evaluate Model and Present Findings**
- **Objective**: Assess model performance and explain variable importance.
- **Actions**:
  - Used cross-validation and evaluation metrics (e.g., ROC-AUC, Accuracy, F1-score) to measure performance.
  - Visualized variable importance and insights using feature importance plots.
  - Summarized findings on a PowerPoint slide using a provided template.
- **Tools Used**: Python (`matplotlib`, `sklearn`), PowerPoint.

## Prerequisites

- **Software**: Python 3.x, Jupyter Notebook
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `xgboost`
- **Dataset**: Place the dataset in the `data` folder.

## Instructions

### 1. **Setup the Environment**
Clone the repository and install the required libraries:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**
- **Explore the Dataset**:
  Open `Predictive Analysis For British Airways.ipynb` and execute cells to perform EDA.
- **Train the Model**:
  Run the same notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

### 3. **Generate the PowerPoint Summary**
- Use the generated visualizations and evaluation metrics to genrat the ppt or you can do manually too.
